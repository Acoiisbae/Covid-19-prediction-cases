# Covid-19 prediction cases
  
  This Deep Learning project aims to predict new cases of Covid-19 in Malaysia using the past 30 days of number of cases by using LSTM neural network. The project involves loading the dataset using pandas, inspecting and cleaning the data, selecting features, preprocessing the data by expanding the dimension of the cases_new column using numpy and performing normalization using Min-Max Scaling, developing a sequential model with LSTM and Dropout layers, compiling the model with adam optimizer and mse loss function and mape and mse metrics, using Early Stopping and TensorBoard callbacks, training the model for 100 epochs, evaluating the model performance using MAPE and MAE, and visualizing the predicted new cases and actual new cases. The model architecture uses LSTM and Dropout as hidden layers and Dense as the output layer with 64 nodes for each layer. The model performance can be improved by adjusting the hidden layers in Model Development.
